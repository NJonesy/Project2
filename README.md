Initial Aims:

User story (plan):

- A user should be able to register, sign-in and out.
- A user should be able to create a team profile.
- A registered user should be able to add a team image, players, post video and upload stills to the team page.
- These actions should only be permitted for a registered user.
- A user should only have the option to post on or edit their team profile.
- A non-registered user should be able to view team profiles.
- A user shoudld be able to search for teams by location.
- A registered user should be able to indicate whether they are in need of players.
- This should be indicated to a non-registered user.
- A non-registered user should be able to contact a registered user without any contact info being displayed.

Where I got to:

    - Trello planning.

    - Wire framing.

    - Model layouts.

    - Devise set-up

    - Team registration, sign-in and out.

    - Image upload. Carrier Wave.

    - Search.

    - Assocations. 

    - Editing capabilities.

    - Restrictions based on whether someone is logged in or out.

    - Single team posting and editing.

    - Styling (incomplete).

    - Heroku deployment.


Features still to add:

    - Improved search. In particular 'closest to'.

    - Player requirement.

    - Messaging.


Challenges/What I would have done differently/What I learned:

    - Planning. Working out exactly what I wanted to achieve. I think I became a bit torn between a number of things and it was difficult to settle on one end goal. In future I will talk an idea through more with 
    others, to get an outside "user" perspective. Really pin pointing exactly what is and isn't necessary to include would have saved time. 

    - Setting up Devise. I'd had some previous issues so was glad that went relatively smoothly. One strong point of my planning was my models so I didn't need to rollback or spend time with lots of migrations. I could have been clearer and mor consistent with column names though.

    - Styling. I left all of my styling until last and feel now that at least getting Foundation set-up earlier and trying a few things out would have been benefitial. Having done little CSS coding up to this point and no experience of using frameworks this part of the project was always going to be a challenge.
